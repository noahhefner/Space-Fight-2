# Space-Fight-2

Space Fight 2 is a single-player, Galaga-inspired shooter game. The objective of the game is to survive against an endless wave of alien spaceships. The aliens occasionally drop helpful power-ups like ammo, lives, and coins (not yet implemented).

This game is programmed in python using pygame's modules. Space Fight 1 was a highschool programming course final project, so Space Fight 2.0 is sort of the "remastered" version.
